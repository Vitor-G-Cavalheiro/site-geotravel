                <span>Bumbódromo</span>
                <span>The highlight of the visit to Parintins is the iconic Bumbódromo, a space where Caprichoso and Garantido take place during the three nights of the Parintins Folklore Festival, since 1965. Created in 1988, the space also guaranteed the party the title of Cultural Heritage of Brazil. The arena, also known as Amazonino Mendes Cultural and Sports Center, becomes the stage that brings to life the legends, rites and customs of the Amazon caboclo. This scenario is portrayed through toadas (songs), allegories, props, dances and beliefs.</span>

                <span>Mercado Municipal</span>
                <span>With a panoramic view of the Amazon River, the Leopoldo Neves Municipal Market, in Parintins, is a symbol of history, architecture, knowledge and flavors of regional cuisine. More than a center for buying and selling products, it reflects the richness of the popular culture of the people of Parintin, their centuries-old customs and traditions. Opened in 1937, the market was reopened on May 27, 2019, celebrating its 82nd anniversary after extensive renovations.</span>

                <span>Praça Cristo Redentor is one of Parintins' beautiful postcards. Bordering the Amazon River, the place has an amphitheater for shows by local artists, a pier, as well as bars and restaurants with typical regional flavors. The attraction was named Praça Digital in 2007, when Parintins offered free broadband internet to visitors and residents.</span>
